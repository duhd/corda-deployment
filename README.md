## B. Network setup step:
1. Set up network map
2. Set up notary
3. Set up bank nodes

The script `configure.sh` from `corda-deployment` repository takes in 5 input parameters:
* Node type (value: networkmap, notary, node)
* Virtual machine (VM) username
* Network Map Name
* Notary type (default value is "nonValidating")
* Network Map IP address

### 1. Set Up Network Map

1\. SSH to Network Map virtual machine.

2\. Clone `corda-deployment` repository
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/duhd/corda-deployment.git
```
3\. Determine network map node name (e.q. Network Map)

4\. Get virtual machine IP address with following command:
```sh
$ hostname -i
```
5\. Execute `configure.sh` script with:
```sh
$ sudo ./configure.sh networkmap <<VM Username>> <<Network Map Name>> nonValidating <<Network Map IP>>
```
   Example:

```sh
# Network map name is "Network Map"
# Network map IP address is "10.0.0.47"
# VM username is "corda"

chmod +x configure.sh
sudo ./configure.sh networkmap corda "Network Map" nonValidating 10.0.0.47
```

Note: Network map IP address is required in the set up of notary node and additional bank nodes

### 2. Set Up Notary

1\. SSH to Notary virtual machine.

2\. Clone `corda-deployment` repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/duhd/corda-deployment.git
```

3\. Determine Notary node name (e.g. Notary)

4\. Get network map IP Address from the previous step (network map setup).

5\.  Execute `configure.sh` script with:
```sh
$ sudo ./configure.sh networkmap <<VM Username>> <<Network Map Name>> nonValidating <<Network Map IP>>>
```

   Example:
```sh
# Notary name is "Corda_Notary"
# Network map IP address is "10.0.0.47"
# VM username is "corda"
$ chmod +x configure.sh
$ sudo ./configure.sh notary corda "Corda_Notary" nonValidating 10.0.0.47
```

### 3. Set Up Bank Nodes

1\. SSH to bank nodes virtual machine.

2\. Clone `corda-deployment` repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/duhd/corda-deployment.git
```

3\. Determine bank node name (usually the bank SWIFT code).

4\. Get network map IP Address from the previous step (network map setup).

5\. Go to `corda-deployment` directory.

6\. Verify `config.properties` to ensure `ApproveRedeemURI` is configured with the Central Bank domain name.
```sh
ApproveRedeemURI=http://<<centralbankdomain>>:9001/meps/redeem
```

7\. Execute `configure.sh` script with:

```sh
$ sudo ./configure.sh notary <<VM Username>> <<Notary Name>> nonValidating <<Network Map IP>>
```
   Example:
```sh
# Nodename name is "Corda_BankA"
# Network map IP address is "10.0.0.47"
# VM username is "corda"

$ chmod +x configure.sh
$ sudo ./configure.sh node corda "Corda_BankA" nonValidating 10.0.0.47
```
Note: do not name the Corda node with a name containing "node".



# Central Deployment and Server Admin

## A. CorDapp Deployment

1\. Copy CorDapp JARs into VM Node 0 into the following directory with SCP/FTP:
```sh
/home/corda/corda-deployment/plugin
```
2\. Log in to VM Node 0 using SSH
3\. Go to `corda-deployment` directory

4\. Execute manage.sh to deploy CorDapp to all nodes in the network except the Notary and the Network Map. The script assumes that the nodes are named sequentially (e.g. 0 to 12):
```sh
$ ./manage.sh deploy 0 12
```

This step does the following:

- Delete everything in /app/corda/plugins
- Copy all files from Node 0's /home/corda/deploy to the target node's /app/corda/plugins folder
- Restart Corda and webserver in the node
- Repeat for selected Nodes

Note: 0 and 12 in Step 4 represents the range of nodes. If you only require deployment on nodes 2-4, change the parameters to "deploy 2 4".

## B. Restart All Nodes
1\. Log in to VM Node 0 using SSH
2\. Go to `corda-deployment` directory
3\. Execute `manage.sh` to restart all nodes in the network (e.g. Node 0 - Node 12):
```sh
$ ./manage.sh restart 0 12
```
Note: 0 and 12 in Step 3 represents the range of nodes. If you only require deployment on nodes 2-4, change the parameters to "deploy 2 4".

## C. Stop All Nodes
1\. Log in to VM Node 0 using SSH
2\. Go to `corda-deployment` directory
3\. Execute `manage.sh` to stop all nodes in the network (e.g. Node 0 - Node 12):
```sh
$ ./manage.sh stop 0 12
```
Note: 0 and 12 in Step 3 represents the range of nodes. If you only require deployment on nodes 2-4, change the parameters to "deploy 2 4".

## D. Clear All Data in Vault
1\. Log in to VM Node 0 using SSH
2\. Check that you are in `/home/corda`
3\. Go to `corda-deployment`
4\. Stop all Corda nodes (node 0 to 12) using:
```sh
$ ./manage.sh stop 0 12
```

5\. Clear all data in network (node 0 to 12) - note that the data is *not recoverable*:

```sh
$ ./manage.sh reset 0 12
```

6\. Restart all nodes 0 to 12:

```sh
$ ./manage.sh restart 0 12
```

## E. Update Node Names
1\. Stop the Corda server and webserver
2\. Go to `/app/corda`
3\. Update `node.conf` with command:
```sh
$ vi node.conf
```
4\. Change `myLegalName` in "O" key :
```sh
"O=BANKA, L=Hanoi, C=Vietnam"
```
5\. Delete the `certificates` folder. The certificates will be regenerated automatically upon Corda server start up
6\. To purge the old entries in the Network Map, login to the h2 DB of the Network Map (nm0) and delete the old entries in `NODE_NETWORK_MAP_NODES` table

Note:

As of Corda v1.0, 'CN' / Common Name field in the X500 is no longer supported. It is used only for services identity. In addition, words such as "node" is blacklisted in CordaX500Name and therefore should not be used.
